----- Version 1.0.2, 2024/03/18

----- Version 1.0.1, 2023/11/08

- A function was added to determine if a location is inside or outside the modeled magnetopause surface. The example program now reflects this change.

- This is the initial release on the NASA-Planetary-Science GitHub repository. The source code is now available for general public use under the BSD 3-Clause License.
